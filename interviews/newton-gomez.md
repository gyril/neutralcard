Call with Newton Gomez, 11/28/16

> Cross River Bank specializes in money movements and loans, for big(ger) customers: he mentions Uber & Lyft, can't disclose others. Wasn't all clear to me what they do exactly.
> They are not doing any issuing at the moment. They have maybe 15 cards on file, not making any money on it. Some customers have asked for them and they managed to issue them.
> They are deciding whether they want to get more involved or not into issuing, says it's an interesting space but had a lot of false starts.
> They started working with First Data, which is not moving fast enough, and are thinking of working with Marqeta, but Marqeta only really has an edge in prepaid, not debit or credit.
> They won't do prepaid, too much hassle. They don't really want to do credit, as the technology is apparently bad.
> They're looking at debit a lot, we can check back in January to see whether they've made a decision.
> They know Synchrony Bank did a lot of that stuff (affinity partnerships), but what he sees is actors are moving away from that market.
> Why? Hard to scale, 3-rd party doesn't deliver, not a profitable endeavor.
> Other than that, he was extremely nice and transparent guy (so refreshing in this industry).
